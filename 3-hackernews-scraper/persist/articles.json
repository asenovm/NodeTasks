It just defies this unconscious tendency to believe a) men can and should to work long hours without breaks to take care of their families and b) women are risky employees because they&#x27;ll keep putting off work for their families. Not saying that either isn&#x27;t true, that everyone thinks this way, etc. Just saying such an unconscious bias exists and that this article shows that wanting to be both a caregiver and a breadmaker for your family isn&#x27;t just a women&#x27;s issue. We shouldn&#x27;t have to take men from their families and keep women from working in order to achieve success. We just need to change the system, somewhere.","commentId":8500578,"isNew":false}],"maxItem":8500578}
