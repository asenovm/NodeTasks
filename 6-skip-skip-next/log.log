    type: 'story',

    comment: 'No, I don&#x27;t think it makes any sense at all. CPUs&#x2F;OSs have built-in mechanisms to automatically adjust frequency depending on the actual workload. If scrolling involves a minimal workload then it should remain in low-power state. This is a really power-hostile solution to solving a problem which should be solved another way. At the very least, if this really is an intractable lag problem (which I doubt - other manufacturers seem unaffected), then the driver should call an OS API that says something like &quot;latency-sensitive user input has started&#x2F;stopped&quot;, and then the OS makes the decision about whether to boost the CPU frequency, or do something more sensible, or be updated in future to use new hardware features to solve the problem even better, etc.<p>This particular hack is just poor engineering. And users should at least be given the choice between &quot;drain my battery or add a bit of lag&quot;, if the manufacturer can&#x27;t figure out how to remove the need to make that choice.',

    comment: 'The problem I personally have had here is that Debian support cycles are <i>way</i> too short, 1 year past the bi-annual release of the new version.  Even the squeeze LTS 1 year additional support experiment is too short.  Hence my new appreciation of RHEL.<p>With Windows there&#x27;s a very good chance you can continue using an old version for a <i>long</i> time.

But I disagree with nearly all of its design decisions. I strongly value software portability between Linux and BSDs regardless of which OS I am using, I don&#x27;t believe in making desktop environments like Gnome 3 (and even desktop applications like Brasero) dependent upon a specific init system, I don&#x27;t believe in monolithic design and prefer stronger decoupling, I prefer text log files to binary log files, I find the documentation on systemd and its APIs appalingly sparse, I am opposed to the heavy-handedness of consuming other libraries like udev, I am greatly opposed to the politics being played out to push its adoption on other distros, on and on.',

    comment: 'depends on your counterfactual.  for some commenters on this thread, that seems to be storing data in plaintext. for me, the more reasonable counterfactual is a recovery key that i have sole control over, or perhaps an encrypted backup onto a disk i have sole control over.<p>i think we agree that encrypting data at rest isn&#x27;t sufficient for keeping private data private, but it may be necessary and is probably beneficial.<p>for some users, keeping keys in microsoft&#x27;s cloud may be a good option, but i think that hinges on whether they know and understand the implications of sending their recovery keys to microsoft.<p>for example, maybe you lose your phone and some pickpocket doesn&#x27;t grab your data very easily, but maybe the local police force gets your recovery key from microsoft and finds nude photos of your significant other before returning your phone to you. i&#x27;d be pretty displeased in that case, even if it helped me get my device back.<p>i suspect many people storing recovery keys with microsoft don&#x27;t know that this is happening, and might have made different choices if they knew that and understood some of the implications.',

    comment: 'What I find more interesting is that parking SHOULD cost more than it does, and if it did, Uber would win the cost-value comparison hands-down.<p>Americans subsidize parking by imposing fees on developers who don&#x27;t include &quot;enough&quot; of it, and by reserving large portions of cities&#x27; streets for car storage.  Multi-billion dollar highways enable sprawl and cheaper commercial parking lots.  Driving &amp; parking personal vehicles is incredibly wasteful from a broad economic perspective (but it was the correct path -- a necessary evil in the absence of density to enable effective mass transit).<p>Even with the government subsidies, Uber is an economically competitive alternative to driving &amp; parking personal vehicles.  That&#x27;s the amazing part.  Public policy favors the incumbent behavior, yet &quot;ride-sharing&quot; has still been able to expose market inefficiencies.  Imagine if we killed all the parking subsidies, or better yet: used economic incentives to discourage driving &amp; parking personal vehicles, and encourage the behavior that had a lower total cost.<p>I believe the future of personal transportation is computer-driven computer-dispatched vehicles, a game Uber and Google are leading.  We can&#x27;t get there soon enough.',

    comment: '&gt; First of all my apologies for &quot;you&quot; I guess it should read &quot;one&quot; - English is not my native tongue.<p>Thanks. It can be used both ways but being a Dutchman I wasn&#x27;t sure. Not my native tongue either :)<p>I understand your issues with publicly funded projects, and where there is money there will always be abuse. I&#x27;ve interned at a company that did research because they could get it subsidized and I know they wouldn&#x27;t if they didn&#x27;t get that money; it was simply too expensive (they didn&#x27;t have a lot to spend). However that is also the goal of the grant&#x2F;subsidy: stimulating companies to do that very research (if I remember correctly it was something about VoIP, not sure).<p>So yeah people make money with it, but it also helps development. I too think that €3 mil is a bit much for 70m of cyclepath, but if it&#x27;s the first in the world... gotta start somewhere when you have huge R&amp;D costs. If you read their FAQ, they are testing for a lot of things like slickness, reflection, strength, etc. I just hope they thought about it more than I did.',

    comment: 'In no way am I trying to incite Mac vs. PC, but after years of Apple laptops I grew bored with their aluminum fascism and decided (last year) to buy a top-of-the-line Thinkpad.<p>A couple of months later, taking a huge economic hit, I sold the Thinkpad and returned to Apple. I simply could not handle the trackpad (and I gave up on the weird Thinkpad nubbin back in the early 2000s). I quite literally felt like I had a degenerative neuromuscular disease when I used the trackpad, and since &quot;mousing&quot; is almost certainly the primary way I interact with a computer, the laptop itself begun to give me a strong, strange aversion to use.<p>I&#x27;m told Microsoft is working on improving trackpads in general, but they should really have every single engineer working on this issue. Forget about new features, let&#x27;s get the simple stuff right.',

    comment: '<p><pre><code>    It&#x27;s like us learning regular English in school but everyone\n    speaks Shakespeare or something (of course it&#x27;s not that\n    dramatic of a difference).\n</code></pre>\nActually it is a pretty dramatic difference. Cantonese and Mandarin split roughly 1000 years ago, whereas the difference between Shakespearian English (which is considered Early Modern English) and Modern English is only a few hundred years.<p>The Chinese writing system tends to obscure these differences because cognates among the different varieties of Chinese are represented using the same characters, even though their pronunciations have diverged considerably. There are vocabulary and grammatical differences as well, though they are not as big.<p>The difference is more akin to if English speakers had to write in German†, but had to read it using English cognates. For instance, if you wanted to say &quot;I know that you said it&quot;, you might have to write:<p><pre><code>    Ich weiß dass du das gesagt hast.\n</code></pre>\nBut you would read it &quot;in your own language&quot;:<p><pre><code>    I wit that thou that y-said hast.\n</code></pre>\nThis is similar to the current relationship between Cantonese and Mandarin. Cantonese speakers write in Mandarin (i.e. &quot;Standard Chinese&quot;) and read it &quot;in Cantonese&quot;, even though when speaking, they would really say something almost completely different. When Cantonese speakers actually write in Cantonese, Mandarin speakers generally would have difficulty reading it.<p>† The difference between English and German actually spans more than 1000 years, but I&#x27;m not as familiar with other closer Germanic languages with which to provide a good example.',

    comment: 'My GF usually works from home and has video on one screen 10-16 hours a day, and concurrently streams to a tablet for about 2-6 hours a day - some of that is concurrent usage, but she also likes to fall asleep with the tablet on (and plugged in).<p>Netflix HD &quot;best quality&quot; apparently uses 2.3G&#x2F;hour, as of 2012. If all the streaming was Netflix HD in best quality, she&#x27;d be using over 1.5T all by herself.<p>However, it&#x27;s not all Netflix HD, so her actual usage is lower. And she&#x27;s also a fan of various talent reality shows, which she sometimes acquires from other sources.<p>Increased bandwidth is similar to increased road capacity. Just like road capacity makes longer and more car trips feasible, increased bandwidth encourages accessing large files remotely and reduces the incentive to cache locally.',

    comment: '&gt;The music industry in Japan came up with a brilliant business model that enabled them to sell the same CD multiple times to the same consumer, basically by bundling a ticket to each CD. Sometimes a single ticket grants you one vote, sometimes you get one piece of (say 12) tickets randomly and you need to complete all 12 pieces to get something. This forces loyal fans to buy 10s and sometimes 100s of the same CD.<p>I don&#x27;t understand what you mean by tickets and votes. It sounds really interesting, and I&#x27;d be grateful if you could elaborate.',

    comment: 'This thread was going fine until someone talked about how apple is superior to all other manufacturers together.<p>This, obviously, needed a proper position from those who believe that Apple is not superior.<p>This whole &quot;Apple is perfect&quot; versus &quot;Apple is for idiots&quot; is pointless, as the majority here already knows. But some people insist in degrading a perfectly fine thread just to reproduce it here.<p>Grow up, guys.<p>BTW, I&#x27;m curious why people are allowed to talk about Google with the same adoration others talk of Apple but receive no counter arguments. Is Hacker News audience biased towards Google or Google is just consensus?',

    comment: 'Some comments on the site, since the topic is kind of ridiculous...  It&#x27;s not immediately obvious you can click on the faces. Also, I&#x27;d like a better overview of what panelists have to say, but it&#x27;s too much clicking to look at person individually. Finally, it could be helpful to write&#x2F;generate a transcript to read versus the video to watch. Some might like the video for added cues, but it would be nice there was an alternative to watching 30 minutes of talking heads.',

    comment: 'So a tax that is regressive represents &quot;progress&quot;?<p>I assume your reference to &quot;progress&quot; is based on an assumption that the tax will produce the intended effect of forcing individuals to make healthier choices, but there&#x27;s no evidence that this is the case. In fact, there&#x27;s evidence that many consumers will just substitute in untaxed high calorie foods[1].<p>[1] <a href="http://www.rti.org/newsroom/news.cfm?obj=5C84B2F7-5056-B100-0CB8AEE3EBB2AE3E" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rti.org&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;news.cfm?obj=5C84B2F7-5056-B100-...</a>',

    comment: 'Honestly, given that I have received circa 30 mendacious, bullshit-argument mailers during election season for this means I would be tempted to vote for E just to spite its opponents, whether or not this was workable.<p>But luckily, all their activity convinces me that the proposition will really work. The soda industry has spent FIFTEEN DOLLARS per SF voter on this. [1] This tells me that it&#x27;s not just about San Francisco. They are scared that if it works here, others will soon follow suit, reducing their profits. So it seems they believe that this sort of tax will have a substantial impact on soda consumption. They&#x27;re telling me that voting for E means a chance of improving the entire country&#x27;s health.

    comment: 'tl;dr - a refutation of statistician Cosma Shalizi’s  essay at <a href="http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/523.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu&#x2F;~crshalizi&#x2F;weblog&#x2F;523.htm...</a> in three parts:<p>(1) &quot;Shalizi’s first error is his assertion that cognitive tests correlate with each other because IQ test makers exclude tests that do not fit the positive [correlation matrix]. In fact, more or less the opposite is true. ... Cognitive tests correlate because all of them truly share one or more sources of variance.&quot;<p>(2) &quot;Shalizi’s second error is to disregard the large body of evidence that has been presented in support of g as a unidimensional scale of human psychological differences. The g factor is not just about the positive [correlation matrix]. A broad network of findings related to both social and biological variables indicates that people do in fact vary, both phenotypically and genetically, along this continuum that can be revealed by psychometric tests of intelligence and that has has widespread significance in human affairs.&quot;<p>(3) &quot;Shalizi’s third error is to think that were it shown that g is not a unitary variable neurobiologically, it would refute the concept of g. However, for most purposes, brain physiology is not the most relevant level of analysis of human intelligence. What matters is that g is a remarkably powerful and robust variable that has great explanatory force in understanding human behavior. Thus g exists at the behavioral level regardless of what its neurobiological underpinnings are like.&quot;<p>Conclusion: &quot;In many ways, criticisms of g like Shalizi’s amount to “sure, it works in practice, but I don’t think it works in theory”. Shalizi faults g for being a “black box theory” that does not provide a mechanistic explanation of the workings of intelligence, disparaging psychometric measurement of intelligence as a mere “stop-gap” rather than a genuine scientific breakthrough. However, the fact that psychometricians have traditionally been primarily interested in validity and reliability is a feature, not a bug. Intelligence testing, unlike most fields of psychology and social science, is highly practical, being widely applied to diagnose learning problems and medical conditions and to select students and employees. What is important is that IQ tests reliably measure an important human characteristic, not the particular underlying neurobiological mechanisms.&quot;',

    comment: 'The trouble is that the cost of a packet is a function of its entire route, not simply size or quantity.<p>The more packets that flow through a congested hop, the more that flow should be charged (whether to the sender or recipient). Peering with a network where the packets are not due to go through heavily contended routes shouldn&#x27;t be a big problem, and nor should peering with a network where the routes for packets being interchanged have similar constraints.<p>Probably, a totally fair system would involve so much accounting that most of the cost would be dominated by it.<p>Let&#x27;s not also forget that Netflix et al. don&#x27;t always rely on peering. They can give their customers a better experience by directly attaching hardware to the ISP&#x27;s network, i.e. edge caching, which itself involves contracts and negotiation, independent of any network neutrality concerns around packets swapped at peering.',
